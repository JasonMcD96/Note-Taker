## Description

Note taker is an app that allows a user to interact with a GUI to take notes that persist on a server. The app uses
express to quickly create a server and create required pathing. To simulate a database, the server assigns a random id to 
a note when it is newly written so that later it can be delted by the user if needed. The file that is used contains JSON 
objects that store the title, body text, and ID of the note.
